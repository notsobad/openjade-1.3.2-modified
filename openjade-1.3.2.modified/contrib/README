README for the OpenJade contrib directory
-----------------------------------------

This directory contains software and documentation that are not an
integral part of OpenJade -- that is, they are not part of a DSSSL
implementation. They may or may not be useful. Your pointage may 
vary.

Here's a list of what's in this directory:

rtf2doc.pl - a Perl script which will take .rtf files generated by 
    Jade and convert them to Word .doc format. In the process, 
    referenced graphic files will be embedded into the documents,
    and page numbers references will be resolved. Requires MS Word
